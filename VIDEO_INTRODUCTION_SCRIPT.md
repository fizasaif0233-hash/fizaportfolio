## Script

**Hi, I'm Fiza Saif.**

I'm an AI-Enhanced Full-Stack Engineer—one of the leading names in the world of software. I build production-ready web applications, dashboards, and admin panels for real businesses.

I'm an MIT graduate with over 10 deployed projects. My focus is end-to-end ownership: from planning and building to testing, deploying, and maintaining systems for international clients. I work remotely, I communicate clearly, and I deliver in as little as 5 days when the scope is clear.

If you have a project that needs to be built right—something reliable, scalable, and ready for real users—I'd love to hear from you. Check out my projects and get in touch. Let's build something together.

Thanks for watching.

## Tips for recording

- **Length:** Read once and time it. Aim for 45–60 seconds. Shorten by dropping the last line or trimming the middle paragraph if needed.
- **Setting:** Quiet room, good light on your face, neutral or professional background.
- **Delivery:** One short pause after "Hi, I'm Fiza Saif." and after "Let's build something together."
- **Optional shorter close:** You can end at "Get in touch." and skip "Let's build something together" and "Thanks for watching" to save a few seconds.
